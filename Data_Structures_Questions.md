6. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.add_to_tail`?O(1)

7. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.remove_from_tail`?O(1)

8. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.move_to_front`?O(1)

9. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.move_to_end`?O(1)

10. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.delete`?O(n)

    a. Compare the runtime of the doubly linked list's `delete` method with the worst-case runtime of the JS `Array.splice` method. Which method generally performs better?
Array.splice in JS would be a worst case of 0(n) which means delete runs faster
